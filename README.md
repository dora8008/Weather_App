Project Overview:
A compact Weather App that fetches and displays real-time weather data for any city using a public weather API. It demonstrates fetch() with async/await, JSON parsing, error handling, and simple UI updates (temperature, conditions, icon, humidity, wind, and local time). The project is beginner-friendly and easy to extend (forecast, geolocation, caching)
Key Features:
Search by city name (case-insensitive).
Shows temperature, weather description, icon, humidity, wind speed, and sunrise/sunset times.
Error handling (city not found / network issues).
Loading state and keyboard support (press Enter to search).
Uses async/await and clean DOM updates.
Responsive, minimal UI
